# Doodle-Classifier

We have some data from Kaggle that is obtained from the game Quick, Draw! where players will draw a picture based on a given word. One thing to keep in mind is that the data is labelled solely based on the what the player has been given. This means that doodles may be incomplete or not anywhere close to what a typical image of what that said picture looks like. The goal of this project is to work towards the given Kaggle goal while having smaller personal goals that apply other data science/machine learning techniques.

Original Goal from Kaggle: Find a way to parse through the data and build a better classifier that can effectively learn from the noisy data set. 

Personal Ideas/Goals: 
- Use the SVD to find dominant shapes
- Count how many strokes are in each picture
- Find a criteria that throw out images
